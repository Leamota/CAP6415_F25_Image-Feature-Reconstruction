Week 1 Log — Image Feature Reconstruction
Dates: 2025-10-28 to 2025-11-09

1. Project setup
- Created public GitHub repo: https://github.com/Leamota/CAP6415_F25_project-Image-Feature-Reconstruction
- Initialized README with project overview.

2. Topic framing
- Defined scope: reconstruct input images from intermediate CNN features of ResNet-50.
- Baseline approach: optimization-based inversion (L-BFGS) leveraging feature perceptual loss and regularizations like total variation and color statistics.
- Stretch goal: train a decoder network to map features → image; compare vs optimization.

3. Data and models
- Dataset: subset of ImageNet (validation split) for initial experiments.
- Backbone model: ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet.
- Environment: PyTorch 2.x, CUDA 11+, Python 3.10.
