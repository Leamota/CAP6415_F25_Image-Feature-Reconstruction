Week 5 Log: Finalization and Reporting

GitHub repository:
https://github.com/Leamota/CAP6415_F25_project-Image-Feature-Reconstruction

Date: 2025-11-26 

Results Compilation:
- Gathered all figures, metrics, and reconstructed image outputs for comparison across layers, decoder variants, and training configurations.
- Organized quantitative evaluation (MSE, PSNR, SSIM) and qualitative examples for clear visual discussion.

Documentation and Reporting:
- Drafted and finalized the main project report, README, and associated documentation to detail the experimental pipeline and its rationale.

Presented explanations of key constraints, underlying methods, and observed findings for interpretability and reproducibility.

Model and Code Preservation:
- Saved final trained model weights and configuration files to ensure reproducibility and reusability for future experiments or peer review.
- Cleaned and annotated codebase for coherence and ease of navigation by other users and reviewers.

Supplementary Material Preparation:
- Created a demo notebook illustrating step-by-step reconstruction and analysis for potential sharing or demonstration.

Summary:
Week 5 focused on thorough documentation, result organization, and presentation. All materials required for grading, review, or future work were compiled, clearly explained, and archived for reproducibility.
