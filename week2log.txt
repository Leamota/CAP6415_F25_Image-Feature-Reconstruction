Week 2 Log – Input Image Reconstruction from Deep Feature

GitHub repository:
https://github.com/Leamota/CAP6415_F25_project-Image-Feature-Reconstruction

Date: 2025-11-11 to 2025-11-14

Progress Summary:
- Finalized dataset selection: opted for ImageNet validation set (ILSVRC2012) due to resource constraints.
- Downloaded 50,000 validation images from the official ImageNet site.
- Acquired ground truth labels from ILSVRC2012_validation_ground_truth.txt via GitHub.
- Confirmed compatibility of dataset with pretrained models (ResNet-50).
- Selected 4 target layers across varying depths for feature extraction.
- Implemented feature extraction pipeline using PyTorch.

Challenges:
- Initial attempts to use full ImageNet-1K were limited by storage and compute capacity.
- Feature map dimensionality varies significantly across layers, requiring custom handling in decoder design.

Notes:
- Validation set provides sufficient diversity for testing reconstruction fidelity.
- Pretrained models retain full ImageNet-1K knowledge, ensuring meaningful feature representations.

- Environment Setup
  - Configured Google Colab environment for efficient experimentation.
  - Installed necessary libraries: PyTorch and other required Python packages.


- Network Design Decisions
  - Evaluated suitability of popular architectures and selected ResNet50 for further experiments.
  - Identified and documented feature layers of interest for inversion tasks.

- Dataset Preparation
  - Downloaded the ILSVRC2012 validation dataset.
  - Organized image files into class-specific folders.

 
- Scripting Tasks
  - Developed and tested scripts to preprocess images.
  - Ensured images are correctly sorted and ready for use in training and evaluation.

Summary
This week, I focused on selecting a dataset that aligns with the project’s core objective while making efficient use of available computational resources. I selected the ImageNet validation set (ILSVRC2012) due to its manageable size and substantial diversity. This choice enables effective testing of image reconstruction model based on deep network feature representation.
