Week 3 Log: Feature Extraction Pipeline


GitHub repository:
https://github.com/Leamota/CAP6415_F25_project-Image-Feature-Reconstruction

Date: 2025-11-13 to 2025-11-22

Progress Summary:

1. Implemented the Feature Extractor
- Developed a modular FeatureExtractor class (`feature_extractor.py`) that attaches forward hooks to four ResNet-50 layers: layer1.2.relu, layer2.3.relu, layer3.5.relu, and layer4.2.relu.
- Enabled extraction of intermediate feature maps from early, mid, deep, and very deep portions of the network.

2. Extraction Testing & Verification
- Ran the extractor on sample image batches to verify correct feature retrieval and order.
- Printed and logged output shapes for each selected layer to confirm the pipeline’s integrity and provide shape references for downstream decoder design.

3. Profiling & Memory Handling
- Profiled the shapes and characteristics of extracted feature maps across layers.
- Planned batch sizes and pipeline structure to fit within Colab's GPU memory limits.

4. Feature Concatenation Utility
- Implemented `extract_and_concat_features.py`, a utility for upsampling features to a common spatial shape and concatenating them for multi-layer experiments.



Summary:
All major components of the deep feature extraction pipeline have been built and files: feature_extractor.py, extract_and_concat_features.py and requirements.txt uploaded.
